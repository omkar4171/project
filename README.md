Problem Statement :
Problem:
The objective of this project is to predict the Zillow Home Value Index (Zestimate) for various properties based on features such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, year built, and other relevant attributes. The Zestimate is Zillow's estimated market value for a home, and the goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the Zestimate as accurately as possible.

Key objectives:

Predict the Zillow Zestimate based on property characteristics.
Understand which features contribute the most to the Zestimate.
Explore different machine learning models and compare their performance.
